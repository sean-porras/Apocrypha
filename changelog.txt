#################
[Sept. 2, 2021] 1.7.1 --> 1.7.5
{AD} Administrative Distribution
 + Added (changelog.txt) file to record all changes to the program
 + Added {main()} function to add recursive trying fail state functionality
 + Added Administrative Distribution Internal Documentation [ADID] Framework
{PriD} Private Distribution
~+ Going to create (pd_Apocrypha.py) file for parity, currently on standby for forking from the master
{PD} Public Distribution
~+ Going to create (CRYphoAPA.py) file for parity, currently on standby for forking from the master.

[Oct. 19, 2021] 1.7.5 --> 1.7.6
{AD} Administrative Distribution
 ~ Modified behavior of gentype input processing to be more robust with handling inputs with unexpected results.
~+ Working to rework the method by which content is processed to be used as a key
    to later allow for the use of expanded hashing of any string as a key

[Oct. 25, 2021] 1.7.6 --> 1.7.7
{AD}
 ~ Modified old way of determining file extension to just use slicing instead of needlessly complex lambda function
~+ Added more comments for future implementation of features, such as one-time warning of character case-modding
 ~ Semantic changes to comments for clarity
 ~ Modified Y/N input options which checks for any input with a first letter equal to 'y' after lowering and stripping.
    Making Y/N input options more robust and resilient towards whitespace.
 ~ Modified Aencode2 key check to check for .txt, .json, and .apoc file extension endings to prevent webbrowser opening.
~~~Planned future implementation of config file with options such as whether to mod character case.
~~~Possible future implementation of multiple inputs and outputs being recorded to a file, perhaps set via config
    as a .txt, .json, or perhaps a custom file type (which could be saved as a binary as an option as well)

[Nov. 2, 2021] 1.7.7 --> 1.7.8
{AD}
 + Uncommented and added import packages for future expanded hashing implementation and config handling.
 + Uncommented and added Config class and config_handler function to create and read a .json config file.
 - Removed commented out legacy code for determining file extension in Adecode1 function
 + Uncommented and added the expanded hashing function for generating a key.
 + Added documentation for all previously not docstringed functions and objects.
 + Added options and changed print statements for future implementations.
[Same Day] 1.7.8 --> 1.7.9
{AD}
 + Added config handling implementation and improved it's handling of inputs
 + Added initial 'C' option for A_func prompt.
 + Added automatic restart after config has been handled.

[Nov. 3, 2021] 1.7.9 --> 1.8.0
{AD}
 + Added config parameters to functions to allow for config use and updated error catching recursion arguments.
 ~ Changed the config handler to allow for an empty string and check for an existing config.json in the root directory.
 + Added force_case option to Config class and integrated it with configuration framework.

For the future implementation:
- Add support for file I/O for messages, and then add a JSON format
- Expanded custom key could scale proportionally for each given message?
- Config file with options such as whether to mod character case.
- Multiple inputs and outputs being recorded to a file, perhaps set via config as a .txt, .json,
    or perhaps a custom file type (which could be saved as a binary as an option as well)
- Add other distro functionality in AD able to be tested via the config file so the file itself doesn't have to be run.
    Update [1.7.2022]: I've decided that the above idea will be nixed.

[Dec. 17, 2021] 1.8.0 --> 1.8.1
{AD}
 + Added 'msg' option for eA_gen.type which implements the expanded_hash function
 ~ Refactored logic with file I/O to account for 'msg' option given no file is necessary
 + Automatic formatting and refactoring done on syntax, line 396 to be fixed in 1.8.2

[Dec. 19, 2021] 1.8.1 --> 1.8.2
{AD}
 + Added 'override_msg_case' config option and implementation to allow for mixed case by default for 'msg' eA_gen.type
 ~ Modified eA_gen.type prompt to include 'msg' option

[Dec. 19, 2021] 1.8.2 --> 1.8.3
{AD}
 + Added 'msg' option for decryption method.
 ~ Handled IndexError possibilities with error messages if enter were pressed for Retry prompts.
 ~ Fixed logic error in force_case handling the 'msg' option without regard to force_msg_case config option.
+~ Updated external documentation.

[Dec. 20, 2021] 1.8.3 --> 1.8.4
{AD}
 ~ Fixed bug with key variable not being defined in 'file' encryption method
 ~ Fixed incorrect version being displayed for all documents
+~ Updated internal documentation.

1.8.4 --> 1.8.5
{AD}
 ~ Fixed bug with clearing the screen throwing an error as old platform check didn't work.

1.8.5 --> 1.8.6
{AD}
 ~ Fixed bug with entering a blank string as a key for the 'msg' option.

[Dec. 25, 2021]
{AD} 1.8.6
 +~Added and modified items to the internal Concept List documentation
{SD} null --> 1.0.0
 + Added Stable Distribution, {SD}, of Apocrypha, starting at version 1.0.0 forked from 1.8.6, currently using the
   same 'master' branch on GitHub initially. Will later separate into 'master' containing the {SD}, and an
   'admin' branch containing the {AD}.
 + Stable dist. currently named 'Apocrypha_stable.py' for ease of uploading as detailed above.
{DOCS}
 ~ Modified changelog format to account for {AD} and {SD} versions and {DOCS} separately and cleaner
 ~ Updated some documentation such as the readme, but only slightly. Will do better I promise :)

[Jan. 2, 2022]
{AD} 1.8.7
 ~ Modified config handler to be resistent to invalid JSON files
 ~ Modified config handler to allow JSON files that don't end in "config.json" as a valid input. Ex. "config_apoc.json"
    is now valid and will be properly read and processed.
{DOCS}
 ~ Updated config handler function documentation.

[Jan. 7, 2022]
{AD} 1.8.7
 + Added comments to un-pushed, current 1.8.7 build which would implement unused character utilization for characters
    not found in the key to be implemented and tested in a later version for evaluation for stable branch merge.
   !!!WARNING!!! The above commented out implementation of this feature is merely a draft, and hasn't been tested.
+#+Planned merge for current 1.8.7 {AD} build to be merged into {SD} 1.0.1 sans comments described above.
+#+Planned addition of error code document detailing not only what the error is, but also where it occurred.
    PUSH THIS RELEASE WITH PLANNED MERGE TO {SD} 1.0.1

[Jan. 10, 2022]
{AD} 1.8.7
+~ Added and changed error messages to include error codes to be found in the errorcodes.md document for further
    information regarding not only where the error occurred exactly but also what could cause it for the user.
{DOCS}
 + Created and updated the errorcodes.md document with all error codes organizing them by category.

[Jan. 12, 2022]
{AD} 1.8.7 --> 1.9.0
 + Added the ability to encode characters that aren't found in the key, somewhat finicky, but works for many characters.
 ~+Planned change of how missing characters are encrypted using a lot more secure and accurate method.

[Jan. 18, 2022]
{AD} 1.9.0
-~ Reduced an if-elif statement for non-matching final key hashes to just an if.
~@-Planned guaranteed removal of the "You can only use ... characters" warning with encryption with the next iteration
    of a more secure and reliable method of encryption for these missing characters.
{SD} 1.0.0 --> 1.0.1
 + Merged {AD} V.1.8.7 with Stable Distribution
{DOCS}
 ~ Updated documentation regarding the current state of missing character encryption.
{PLANS}
 * {AD} 2.0.0 soft requirements:
    - Ability to encrypt almost any character reliably and securely
    - One-line command line functionality
    - Full config implementation (every config option has been implemented and has a function)
    - Standardization of changelog entry prefixes and retroactive updating according to those standards
    - Ideally: Modifiable persistent config path

[Jan. 19-22, 2022]
{AD} 1.9.0 --> 1.9.1
 ~+Changed and improved the method for encrypting characters not found in the key.
 ~ Modified old warning on acceptable characters to warn to not use $ or ^ in encryption.
    On a standard US-en keyboard layout, only these characters are known to cause issues.
 ^ Fixed unhandled error of being able to hit enter upon being prompted for "A_func"
{DOCS}
 ~ Updated documentation to be consistent with {AD} 1.9.1, including an added notice in errorcodes.md
 ?~Possible update to changelog.txt to turn into a .md file instead.
{PLANS}
-->Next {SD} update will most likely be an {AD} 1.9.## future release. {AD} 1.9.1 is a release candidate for {SD} 1.1.0
    for which the first 4 versions of {SD} may be lovingly referred to as Versions 4, 5, 6, and 7, as read in binary.
-->For Version 6 ({SD} 1.1.0) to be merged with {AD} 1.9.1 on master, more rigorous testing is required.
